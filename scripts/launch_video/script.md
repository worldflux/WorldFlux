## Reading Guide for VO Recording

**General directions**:
- Speak at ~150 WPM (natural conversational pace)
- Every `[PAUSE 0.5s]` = half-second breath pause
- **Bold** words = slight emphasis (not shouting — just weight)
- `[↑]` = rising intonation (curiosity) | `[↓]` = falling intonation (authority)
- Record in a quiet room, close-mic (6–8 inches), no reverb
- Do 3 takes of each scene; you'll pick the best in edit

## Scene 1 — Hook (0:00–0:05)

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Timecode** | 0:00–0:05 |
| **Duration** | 5.0 sec |
| **Visual** | Dark screen. "WEEKS" fades in large (#F0883E). Strikethrough animates. "ONE COMMAND" appears in green (#7EE787). |
| **Overlay Text** | `WEEKS` → ~~`WEEKS`~~ → `ONE COMMAND` |
| **Subtitle** | *World model integration takes weeks. What if it was one command?* |

**VO Script**:
> World model integration takes **weeks**. [PAUSE 0.3s]
> What if it was [PAUSE 0.2s] **one command**? [↑]

**VO Notes**: Start matter-of-fact — "takes weeks" is a shared frustration you and the viewer both know. Hit "weeks" with dry weight. Then shift to curiosity: "one command?" should sound like a genuine question, almost conspiratorial. This is the scroll-stopper — the first 3 seconds must land.

## Scene 2 — Intro (0:05–0:07)

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Timecode** | 0:05–0:07 |
| **Duration** | 2.0 sec |
| **Visual** | Clean dark frame. "YOSHI" in Inter Black 64px. Below: "Founder" + WorldFlux logo. |
| **Overlay Text** | `YOSHI` / `Founder` + WorldFlux logo |
| **Subtitle** | *I'm Yoshi, founder of WorldFlux.* |

**VO Script**:
> I'm **Yoshi**, founder of **WorldFlux**. [↓]

**VO Notes**: Warm, direct, human. 2 seconds is tight — say it cleanly and move on. No lingering. This is about putting a name to the product.

## Scene 3 — Demo / HERO SHOT (0:07–0:15)

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Timecode** | 0:07–0:15 |
| **Duration** | 8.0 sec |
| **Visual** | Real OBS screen recording. `worldflux init` runs, Rich UI wizard flashes through at 4x, "✅ Project created" lands. |
| **Overlay Text** | *(none — terminal IS the visual)* |
| **Subtitle** | *One command — model, training, inference — ready to run.* |

**Terminal Flow** (sped up to fit 8 sec):
```
$ worldflux init
🚀 WorldFlux CLI  |  scaffold world-model projects

┌─ Guided Setup ──────────────────────────────────┐
│ Project name: my-world-model                    │
│ Environment: atari                               │
│ Model: dreamer:ci [recommended]                  │

│ 2. worldflux train          # start training    │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**VO Script**:
> **One command** — [PAUSE 0.2s] model, training, inference — [PAUSE 0.2s] **ready to run**. [↓]

**VO Notes**: Rhythmic delivery — each short phrase is its own beat. The terminal is moving fast on screen; your voice should be calm and grounded as counterpoint. "Ready to run" is the payoff; deliver with quiet confidence. This is the hero shot — give it space.

## Scene 4 — Architecture Switch (0:15–0:20)

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Timecode** | 0:15–0:20 |
| **Duration** | 5.0 sec |
| **Visual** | Split-screen code cards. Left: `"dreamerv3"` in #58A6FF. Right: `"tdmpc2"` in #58A6FF. Arrow connects them. Below: "Same API." |
| **Overlay Text** | `"dreamerv3"` ⟷ `"tdmpc2"` / `Same API.` |
| **Subtitle** | *Swap architectures in one line. Same API.* |

**Code Block** (left → right transition):
```python
# Left side
model = create_world_model("dreamerv3", ...)

# Right side (slides in)
model = create_world_model("tdmpc2", ...)
```

**VO Script**:
> Swap architectures in **one line**. [PAUSE 0.3s] **Same API**. [↓]

**VO Notes**: "One line" is almost throwaway — it should sound trivially simple. "Same API" is the punch — lower your pitch, deliver with authority. 5 seconds, 1 concept. Don't rush.

## Scene 5 — Close (0:20–0:28)

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Timecode** | 0:20–0:28 |
| **Duration** | 8.0 sec |
| **Visual** | Logo centered → tagline fades in → "COMING SOON" badge pulses → Follow + DM CTA buttons slide up. |
| **Overlay Text** | WorldFlux logo + `One API. Infinite Imagination.` + `COMING SOON` badge + Follow/DM buttons |
| **Subtitle** | *One API. Infinite imagination. Coming soon. DM for early access.* |

**VO Script**:
> **One API**. [PAUSE 0.3s] Infinite imagination. [PAUSE 0.5s]
> **Coming soon**. [PAUSE 0.2s] DM for **early access**. [↓]

**VO Notes**: "One API" = mic-drop tagline, full gravity. "Infinite imagination" — slightly wider, almost poetic. Then brief pause to shift gears. "Coming soon" = confident tease, not apologetic. "Early access" = urgency and exclusivity. End with energy — you're inviting them into something special. The last 2 seconds are visual-only hold (no VO) for the CTA to register.

## Timing Budget

| Scene | Duration | Cumulative | Words | Purpose |
|-------|----------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 Hook | 5.0s | 0:05 | 12 | Scroll-stop: pain → promise |
| 2 Intro | 2.0s | 0:07 | 6 | Human credibility |
| 3 Demo | 8.0s | 0:15 | 13 | Hero shot: real product |
| 4 Switch | 5.0s | 0:20 | 8 | Core value prop: unified API |
| 5 Close | 8.0s | 0:28 | 12 | Tagline + CTA |
| **Total** | **28.0s** | | **51** | |

## What Was Cut (from 57s version)

| Scene | Duration | Reason |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Imagination Rollout | 9s | Requires explanation; loses non-technical viewers |
| Built for Production | 7s | Credibility claims belong in longer-form content |
| Market Stats | 6s | Investor-oriented; text post can supplement |
| Tagline (standalone) | 5s | Merged into Close scene |
| **Total saved** | **27s** | 57s → 28s (51% reduction) |
