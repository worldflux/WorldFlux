# Tutorial Placeholder Policy

WorldFlux keeps tutorial URLs stable even when a tutorial body is temporarily unavailable.

## Policy

- Placeholder tutorial pages remain published to avoid broken inbound links.
- Placeholder pages must clearly state temporary unavailability.
- Placeholder pages must link to supported alternatives in Getting Started/API docs.
- Promotion to full tutorial content is additive and must not break existing links.

## Current Placeholder Tutorials

- `docs/tutorials/train-first-model.md`
- `docs/tutorials/dreamer-vs-tdmpc2.md`
- `docs/tutorials/reproduce-dreamer-tdmpc2.md`

This policy preserves public contracts while enabling staged documentation rollout.
