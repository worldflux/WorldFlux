# Docs Stack

This page defines the documentation tooling used by WorldFlux and explains why each library is included.

## Purpose

- Keep docs authoring simple (`MkDocs` + Markdown).
- Keep API docs synchronized with code (`mkdocstrings`).
- Catch documentation regressions early in CI (strict build + external link checks).
- Stay pragmatic: adopt only what is needed for the current project size.

## Adopted Libraries (WorldFlux)

| Library | Why it is used |
|---|---|
| `mkdocs` | Static docs site generator for the full docs set |
| `mkdocs-material` | Production-ready theme and navigation UX |
| `mkdocstrings[python]` | Autogenerated API reference from Python docstrings |
| `mkdocs-autorefs` | Automatic cross-references between pages and symbols |
| `mkdocs-redirects` | Safe URL/path migrations for docs pages |
| `mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized-plugin` | Page update metadata from git history |
| `mkdocs-minify-plugin` | Smaller generated HTML output |
| `pymdown-extensions` | Markdown quality-of-life features (tabs, fences, details) |

## Not Adopted in This Revision (and why)

| Candidate | Deferred reason |
|---|---|
| `Sphinx` migration | Not required for current docs scale; higher maintenance cost |
| `Astro` / `Docusaurus` migration | Would add a second docs stack without immediate ROI |
| Vale style linting | Useful but out of scope for the current minimal change set |
| Snippet execution pipeline | Valuable, but deferred to keep CI/runtime cost low |

## Standard Commands

```bash
uv sync --extra docs
uv run mkdocs serve
uv run mkdocs build --strict
```

## Policy

- Runtime API/architecture is unchanged by docs-tooling updates.
- Docs dependencies must remain minimal and clearly justified.
- New docs tooling should be added only when a concrete docs quality gap exists.
